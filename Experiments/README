1. To obatin the result of Table VII, the corresponding .out can be find in the following folders:
  (w/ Z w/ seg) & (w/ Z w/o seg): Fig16a_1.term_Z_128_Amp_0_8_mv_300_new_noise_Z_success

  (w/o Z w/ seg): TabVI_5.sec_performance_A_B_new_noise_Z

  (w/o Z w/o seg): Fig16a_2.term_wo_Z_key_128_new_noise_Z

  The generated .out files can be used for NIST test.
